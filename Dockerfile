# The idea here is that we pre-pack all the tools into the Docker/Podman image that can be used for any device:
# (which are toolchains, binutils -- everything except device-specific kernel source);
# 
# This significantly reduces the total build time, as each time we make a build call for a device,
# only device-specific kernel source is being downloaded into the container.
