## Description

The codebase of this project is an extensive build wrapper automating the entire Android kernel build process, starting from kernel source collection and ending with artifact packaging.

The key goal is to modify the kernel in such a way that enables unique features of [Kali NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter) â€” a ROM layer designed to add extended functionality for penetration testing in a mobile form factor.

The architecture of this wrapper is ~~trying to be~~ as modular as possible, making it a little easier to add support for new devices.

## Kernel Features

The kernel has the following features:

- Kali NetHunter support;
- RTL8812/21AU + RTL8814AU + RTL8187 Wi-Fi drivers;
- packet injection support for internal Wi-Fi chipset;
- optional KernelSU support.

## Supported Devices & ROMs

<details>
<summary>OnePlus 5/T</summary>

- 4.4 Linux kernel version:
  - LineageOS;
  - ParanoidAndroid;
  - x_kernel supported (universal)`*`.

- 4.14 Linux kernel version:
  - ParanoidAndroid (unofficial & testing);
  - x-ft_kernel supported (universal)`**`.

`*` -- this is mostly relevant to ROMs based on LineageOS; however, technically speaking, this includes ParanoidAndroid as well, which makes x_kernel-based builds universal.

`**` -- this, **in theory**, is relevant to all 4.14-based ROMs for this device in existence.

</details>

## Usage

The custom build wrapper (aka "builder") consists of 2 core components and 3 primary commands:

Components:

- kernel builder;
- assets collector.

Commands:

- kernel;
- assets;
- bundle.

```help
$ python3 builder --help
usage: builder [-h] [--clean] {kernel,assets,bundle} ...

A custom builder for the zero_kernel.

positional arguments:
  {kernel,assets,bundle}
    kernel              build the kernel
    assets              collect assets
    bundle              build the kernel + collect assets

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --clean               clean the root directory
```

### Prerequisites

**It is highly recommended to use `docker` option to run this tool.** For that you need Docker Engine or Docker Desktop, depending on your OS.

> [!WARNING]
> Because of how *specific* Linux kernel source is, building it on Windows even with Docker (using WSL2 back-end) might be [challenging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76754956/how-to-clone-the-linux-kernel-repository-to-my-machine-i-keep-geting-errors).

To run this tool in a `local` environment, you will need:

- a Debian-based Linux distribution (other types of distros are untested);
- a few [packages](Dockerfile#L15) installed in your system.

You will also need to configure your Python installation, including some of the packages installation:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python3 -m pip install poetry
python3 -m poetry install --no-root
```

### Kernel

Kernel build process can be launched using the `kernel` subcommand.

```help
$ python3 builder kernel --help
usage: builder kernel [-h] --build-env {local,docker,podman} --base
                      {los,pa,x,aosp} --codename CODENAME --lkv LKV [-c]
                      [--clean-image] [--log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}]
                      [-o OUTLOG] [--ksu]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --build-env {local,docker,podman}
                        select build environment
  --base {los,pa,x,aosp}
                        select a kernel base for the build
  --codename CODENAME   select device codename
  --lkv LKV             select Linux Kernel Version
  -c, --clean           don't build anything, only clean kernel directories
  --clean-image         remove Docker/Podman image from the host machine after
                        build
  --log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}
                        select log level
  -o OUTLOG, --output OUTLOG
                        save logs to a file
  --ksu                 add KernelSU support

```

### Assets

As mentioned, there is also an asset downloader, which can collect latest versions of ROM, TWRP, Magisk and it's modules, Kali Chroot etc.

```help
$ python3 builder assets --help
usage: builder assets [-h] --build-env {local,docker,podman} --base
                      {los,pa,x,aosp} --codename CODENAME --chroot
                      {full,minimal} [--rom-only] [--clean-image] [--clean]
                      [--log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}] [-o OUTLOG] [--ksu]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --build-env {local,docker,podman}
                        select build environment
  --base {los,pa,x,aosp}
                        select a kernel base for the build
  --codename CODENAME   select device codename
  --chroot {full,minimal}
                        select Kali chroot type
  --rom-only            download only the ROM as an asset
  --clean-image         remove Docker/Podman image from the host machine after
                        build
  --clean               autoclean 'assets' folder if it exists
  --log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}
                        select log level
  -o OUTLOG, --output OUTLOG
                        save logs to a file
  --ksu                 add KernelSU support
```

### Bundle

The `bundle` command is a combined usage of kernel builder and assets collector core modules.

This is especially useful for linking the kernel build with the appropriate ROM build.

There are cases when an old kernel build is used with the newer ROM build. Such cases can ultimately lead to your system working improperly or breaking down completely, which is why it is important to use a *specific* kernel build with a corresponding ROM build.

Currently, there are three types of packaging available:

- `conan`;
- `slim`;
- `full`.

Options `full` and `conan` collect all of the assets required to successfuly flash the kernel onto your device. The difference between the two is that `full` option places everything into a local directory, while `conan` organizes everything as a Conan package.

Option named `slim` is a much lighter version of `full` packaging, as only the ROM is collected from the asset list. This is done to reduce package sizes while ensuring the kernel+ROM compatibility.

```help
$ python3 builder bundle --help
usage: builder bundle [-h] --build-env {local,docker,podman} --base
                      {los,pa,x,aosp} --codename CODENAME --lkv LKV
                      --package-type {conan,slim,full} [--conan-upload]
                      [--clean-image] [--log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}]
                      [-o OUTLOG] [--ksu]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --build-env {local,docker,podman}
                        select build environment
  --base {los,pa,x,aosp}
                        select a kernel base for the build
  --codename CODENAME   select device codename
  --lkv LKV             select Linux Kernel Version
  --package-type {conan,slim,full}
                        select package type of the bundle
  --conan-upload        upload Conan packages to remote
  --clean-image         remove Docker/Podman image from the host machine after
                        build
  --log-level {normal,verbose,quiet}
                        select log level
  -o OUTLOG, --output OUTLOG
                        save logs to a file
  --ksu                 add KernelSU support
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of commands:

**(Recommended)** Build kernel and collect ROM via Docker:

```sh
python3 builder bundle --build-env=docker --base=los --codename=dumpling --lkv=4.4 --package-type=slim
```

Build kernel locally:

```sh
python3 builder kernel --build-env=local --base=los --codename=dumpling --lkv=4.4
```

Collect all of the assets locally:

```sh
python3 builder assets --build-env=local --base=los --codename=dumpling --package-type=full
```
